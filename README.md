This is for our subject project TIS4103 - Internet Based System Development Methodologies

This application will be more focused on four major modules based on the main task that will be carried out. The modules are 

1. Registration User Module - register as Client or Runner
2. Request Task Module - Client request task in apllication
3. Search Task Module  - Runner will be search task depend on their area
4. Status Task Module - Client will be check status task that had been requested while runners will be change status of the task that will be done by them.

For the web development process we choose OOHDM ( The Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Model)

5 step process

1. Requirement gathering - Collect user (Client and Runner) requirement
2. Conceptual Design - Application domain is built using well-known object-oriented modeling principles, augmented with some primitives 
3. Navigation Design - Induced from navigation classes such as nodes, links, indices, and guided tours.
4. Abstarct Interface Design - Handle external and user-generated events and how communication takes place between interface and navigational objects.
5. Implementation - Implementation maps interface objects to implementation objects.
